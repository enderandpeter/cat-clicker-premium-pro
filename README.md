# Cat Clicker Premium Pro

A solution for the [Cat Clicker Premium Pro exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe6SYU45a-s) in the Udacity course called [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989).

## v0.1

There is very minimal styling. The full Pro version has preset cats in the `images` folder which are assigned names in `index.js`. There is an Admin
panel where you can set the image URL, number of clicks, and name.
